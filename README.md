What is PATLocker?

PATLocker is a place to store all your PAT records.

We are a resource for both the PAT testing community, businesses of all sizes and individuals who require PAT test records for insurance purposes and public transparency.

From the side of the PAT Tester, the site works as a directory of your customers, their appliances and their records.

The use of this facility can be a selling point of your services. It can aso remind you who needs their PAT records updating. You then know to make that call.

From the business and individuals side, your PAT tests can be either publicly or privately accessed from the cloud. All your appliances and details are stored along with all PAT records pertaining to each appliance. You can copy a snippet of code onto your website and have a record search box for full transparency to your clients, H&S advisors and insurance brokers. Or you can keep details private and only access them yourself.
