					PAT testing is a commonly used method where trained and competent people use visual methods and special test equipment to check the safety of an electrical appliance.  The various test results are then recorded in a document and made available to the owner of the appliance. The PAT operator is commonly independent and they maintain and keep the test records of many companies. The PAT operator could also work in-house, meaning that a company employee can perform the tests and keep the records. Regular testing is essential as insurance companies are increasingly requiring these tests to be performed. so the test records must be kept up to date.

					The motivation to build this software comes from having performed in-house PAT myself, it became difficult to maintain the many paper records and to make available to hiring companies the particular records that we needed. It was also easy to forget items with so many having different ‘Do not use after’ dates.

					While it is possible and common for these tasks to be performed with only paperwork, I believe that the use of software will make the task not only quicker, more thorough but also more accessible. There are allready software solutions but these are expensive and tied to only one computer.
